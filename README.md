# Tutorial on Event-based Neural Networks for Neuromorphic Machine Learning
This tutorial was created for a session at the International Conference on Neuromorphic Systems 2024, Arlington, Virginia, USA.
We prepared a set of notebooks to get started with some of our work on event-based neural networks.

## Event-based State Space Model
